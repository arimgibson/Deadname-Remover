## v2.1.0

- Added keyboard shortcut functionality for quickly enabling/disabling the extension
- Added setting to replace plain text email addresses (Note: Email hyperlinks remain unchanged and will use the original address when clicked)
- Added setting to hide debug logs that contain name mapping information (including deadnames) (thanks [@Lenochxd](https://github.com/Lenochxd)!)
- Resolved UI issue causing switches to not show an indicator when focused
- Excluded SVGs from processing to improve performance

## v2.0.4

- Resolves bug with names not replacing while maintaining performance.

## v2.0.2
