# Deadname Remover üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

Deadname Remover is a browser extension that replaces deadnames with chosen names (primarily for transgender and non-binary people). By installing it, you can avoid the discomfort of seeing your or a friend/family member's deadname while browsing the web.

- **Replaces deadnames**: Add infinite deadname and chosen name pairs to process and replace on most (if not all) websites
- **Privacy-first**: All data processing locally on device. No data collection or browsing history stored. Settings remain local by default, with optional browser sync. See [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for more details
- **Performant**: Extremely lightweight, no noticeable difference in page load times. Can run on low-end devices including Chromebooks
- **Pride themes**: Add trans pride and non-binary pride gradient highlights on replaced names
- **Syncing settings across devices**: Keep your settings in sync across all your devices (disabled by default for privacy reasons)
- **Content blocking**: Prevent flashing of deadnames by blocking page content before the extension has finished processing (optional)
- **Stealth mode**: Hide the extension icon to protect privacy and avoid being outed. Recommended to disable text highlighting as well.
